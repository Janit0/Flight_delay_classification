# Flight_delay_classication_prediction_and_analysis
This project is to analyse the delay pattern of flights and create a optimum classification model of whether flights should/will be cancelled or not.

### Project Scenario:
As airplanes have become the fastest means of transport to travel to long distances, there are certain factors which are always considered by the Airline industry such as delays, weather and so on which may or may not lead to canellation of flight, thus it is crucial to identify the factors leading to the possibility of flight cancellation to furhter assist airline industry to be prepared for such obstacles.

### Project Objectives: 
1. Analyse and preprocess the data for better results
2. observe and evaluate patterns using visualizations
3. create an optimum model for prediction
